# Cube 2 engine fork

This is a fork of the [Cube 2](http://cubeengine.com/) engine for my own development.

The `sauerbraten` branch is a mirror of the [Sauerbraten SVN repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/sauerbraten/code/HEAD/tree/), with some directories omitted (builds and non-open-source content). It can be updated with the command: `git svn fetch --ignore-paths="^(bin|bin64|bin_unix|packages|sauerbraten\\.app)"`.

The `devel` branch is my development branch, starting from the "2020 Edition" release of Sauerbraten (`2020-edition` tag / `r6490` on SVN).
